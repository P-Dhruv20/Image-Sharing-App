## Overview
(INSERT APP NAME) is a simple but refined media platform where users connect with each other through photo sharing.

Security is the most important component of (INSERT NAME). We want to ensure that user content remains secure 
as it is viewed and commented on by the rest of the internet. To maintain integrity of our app, 
we require users to create profiles in order to access shared content. User login passwords are secured using 
bycrpt hashing.
